Lots of people on Pseudolonewolf's social/flash forum [Fig Hunter][1] have 
been interested in my chat room scripts which provide me with automatic text
coloration and tab-completion and so on. I have decided to make these public
via github.

To the extent possible by law, I hereby waive all copyright and any related 
rights to this code under the Creative Commons Zero waiver/license, which you 
may read online at:

This means that you may copy, distribute, modify, and use my code without any 
fear of lawsuits from me. As it says at the above URL, my code is provided 
with NO WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. I do humbly request that you provide me some 
sort of attribution or credit if you use it; but I leave that decision up to 
you.
